title: "Monitoring the Monitorer"
---

## What ##
I've come up with a little side project that I will be running over the next month and probably much beyond that. I have decided to monitor myself. 

## How ##
I will be monitoring my daily habits with a Fitbit, my sleeping habits with the Fitbit and a WakeMate, and my daily stats with a Withings scale.

## Why ##
I don't have a good answer for that except that I am really interested in learning more about myself and my habits. I'm hoping this will give me some insight into myself.

I will go into more detail as to what i will be tracking with each of devices as they arrive and I get some time to set them up and play with them.
