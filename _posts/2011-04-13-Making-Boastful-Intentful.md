title: Making Boastful Intentful
---

[Zach Holman](http://zachholman.com/) created a nifty jQuery plugin so you can 'trawl Twitter for people linking to you' called [Boastful](https://github.com/holman/boastful). I use and love it, but it was missing [Web Intents](http://dev.twitter.com/pages/intents) so I added them. [Take a look at](https://github.com/danielmcgraw/boastful), [Clone](git@github.com:danielmcgraw/boastful.git), [Copy](https://github.com/danielmcgraw/boastful/blob/master/jquery.boastful.js) and [Fork](https://github.com/danielmcgraw/boastful/fork) the code and let me know what you think.
